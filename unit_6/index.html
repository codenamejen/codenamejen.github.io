				<h2>Top 5 Hikes in New Zealand</h2>
			<section class="hikes">	
				<h3>1. Milford Track, South Island</h3>
				<img src="images/milford.jpg" alt="Picture of Milford Track New Zealand">
				<p>Referred to as "The finest walk in the world." and I would be inclined to believe it! We were gifted the perfect weather at the top of the pass, a real rare thing to have 30 minutes of sunlight in one of the rainiest places on earth.</p>

				<h3>2. Tongariro Circuit, North Island</h3>
				<img src="images/tongariro.jpg" alt="Picture of Tongariro Circuit in  New Zealand">
				<p>I had 1.5 days to do the whole 28-mile trek as opposed to the usual 3-4 days. I hated that I was rushed but I couldn't stand to leave New Zealand without doing this trek, so I hauled ass between beautiful vistas and made it work!</p>

				<h3>3. Routeburn Track, South Island</h3>

				<p>My first 'Great Walk' blew my mind. Then I wanted to do them all!</p>

				<h3>4. Abel-Tasman Park, South Island</h3>
				<img src="images/abel.jpg" alt="Picture of Abel-Tasman Track New Zealand">
				<p>I left my camera behind so only took shots on my phone but these panoramas paint a pretty good picture. I also had limited time to do this trek and averaged 20 mile days to get through this in time to catch the last boat out at one of the bays.</p>

				<h3>5. Matukituki Valley, South Island</h3>
				<img src="images/matukituki.jpg" alt="Picture of Matukituki Valley New Zealand">
				<p>Fields of flowers, Rob Roy Glacier, the Aspiring Hut, and glowworms to boot. Paradise.</p>
